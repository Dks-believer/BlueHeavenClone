First of all i would like to thank you masai school to giving us a great opportunity,which help us to implement and experiment with what we have learned both in soft skills and coding.
## Introduction
The project we got alloted is to clone the website of Blue Heaven Cosmetics Pvt.Ltd in IndiaMart.com, IndiaMART InterMESH Ltd. is an Indian e-commerce company that provides B2B and customer to customer sales services via its web portal. The group began in 1996, a business-to-business portal to connect Indian manufacturers with buyers.And Blue Heaven Cosmetics was started in 1974 by two young brothers.

We tried our best to clone the website in  this limited time of one week. Actually this was a tough journey for me and my team members to do complete this in given time,
because we have no pior experience in collaboration. However our team was so great that can understand each ones potential and assign the task ourself and get it done on time.
